                    <p >In Island of the Last Survivor, you awaken on a mysterious island with only a machete in hand and a daunting mission ahead. On the beach, you discover a dead man clutching a worn diary. The journal reveals the dark history of a once-thriving village, now wiped out by relentless monster attacks that emerge at the end of every month. The last survivor of the village planned an escape, leaving behind a blueprint for a ship—but he didn't survive long enough to build it.

                        Now, it’s up to you. You have just 3 days before the next monstrous onslaught. Armed with the machete and a sword you find, you must gather resources, build your ship, and escape before it’s too late. Each day, the threat intensifies, with more dangerous creatures appearing as time runs out.

                        Featuring a building system, inventory management, and escalating monster encounters, Island of the Last Survivor tests your survival skills. Will you have what it takes to outlast the monsters and sail to freedom before the island claims your life too?
