                            is a game demo designed to showcase my skills as a game programmer. The player awakens in a broken elevator deep underground, with no clear escape route. As they explore, they find two weapons: a pistol for close encounters and a unique rock-thrower, capable of grabbing and launching rocks at enemies.

                            The real challenge begins when the player enters a mysterious room and faces a strange monster with dynamic combat abilities. The monster can dash at the player or hurl rocks from a distance, requiring quick reflexes and strategic use of cover. When the monster's health drops to half, the battle evolvesâ€”he flies into the air, attacking with three rocks at a time, telegraphing his moves by making the rocks vibrate on the ground. As the player dodges, they must anticipate the attacks and return fire.

                            In the final phase, with his health at a quarter, the monster forms a fiery shield, blocking all damage. To defeat him, the player must use explosives hidden in the room. By attaching explosives to rocks, and launching them with the rock thrower, the player can break the shield and land the finishing blow.

                            Once the monster is defeated, the player reaches a working elevator, and the demo concludes.
