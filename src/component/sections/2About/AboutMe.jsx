                    <p className="about-decribtion"> 3 years ago I started by making some of the fundamentals that everyone is making as their first games like (Brick Breaker, Battery man, etc) after that 
                        I began to make some of my own games so I developed pacman in first person but the player has his advantages, after that 
                        I created a boss fight demo where I really wanted to test a specific mechanic and make a boss that's hard to defeat, then made island of the last survivor 
                        I learned a lot from this game it has a building system, inventory system, items system, monster spawning system.
